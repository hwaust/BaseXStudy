¡°Whole¡± comes from ¡°unhurt¡±, and means a single object that has not been subdivided.
¡°Entire¡± comes from ¡°complete¡±, and means no part has been left out.

They are different when you are talking about collections of objects; 
the entire lot of cars, or the entire staff, since these are collections of distinct objects. 
You would say a whole loaf of bread or a whole person, since these are single objects not usually considered a collection of parts.

The expression ¡°whole life¡± considers one¡¯s life to be a single unit that has not been subdivided. 
An ¡°entire life¡± means all the parts (years? experiences?) of a life. In this case either could be used.
