[Question]
Could you please tell me the differences between the following sentences?

He was found guilty of having heroin(drug).
He was found guilty of possessing heroin.

Neither of them owned a credit card. 
Neither of them possessed a credit card.
And if you know other words which can be replaced by these words, I'd be glad if you teach me them.

Well they all have a very similar meaning! Good question :P

Nowadays possession is usually a more formal or polite word that is used especially when describing law. Possession is typically used when referring to someone who is caught carrying something on them (especially drugs or illegal items). For example, It is not normal to say 'He was found guilty of having heroin'. In this way possession does not always mean that you own the thing you possess. If someone gave you a drug you would be possessing that drug. However in most other cases when you say that you possess something you usually mean that you own it. For example, 'I possess a TV'.

For almost any situation I think you can replace own' with 'have', but you can't always replace 'have' with 'own'. For example, you can say 'I own a bike' or 'I have a bike', but if you say 'I have a cold' or 'I have his coat', you can't say 'I own a cold' or I own his coat'. In these examples the sentence makes no sense or changes its meaning. In this way, 'have' can mean 'am carrying' or 'am holding' or 'infected with'. To own something means that the item belongs to you.

There aren't many other single words that mean the same,
In certain situations you may want to use the following words:

to hold on to
to carry
to keep
to retain
to acquire
to obtain

I hope that helps!
