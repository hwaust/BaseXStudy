While they may be used interchangeably in casual conversation, they actually
have different meanings. From an etymological dictionary:

Odd (a jut of land):
Something not usual or expected. Has no special positive or negative
connotation. Winning a lottery would be odd but neither weird nor strange.

Weird (fated):
Something supernatural or beyond human understanding. A fortune-teller
predicting your future would be weird, but probably neither odd nor strange.

Strange (foreign):
Something unfamiliar. A type of material (rock, cloth, or such) you've never
seen before would be strange but not weird, and odd only if it were otherwise
unusual or rare.
