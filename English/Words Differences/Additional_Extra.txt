To have "extra" of something, has always seemed to imply to me, that the
additional object(s), were in place in case something unusual happened to the
ordinarily required amount. For instance I carry an extra pair of boots, and
socks in my bus during mud season, in case I get stuck and have to assist the
tow truck driver. I carry additional fish hooks in my tackle box, and I expect
to have to use the extra ones in the course of a usual day of fishing.
