that is based on dealing with specific situations instead of on ideas and

Both quite close, but as you can see there seems to be bit of a connotative
difference, with "pragmatic" being a bit more academic. I'd probably argue
that while pragmatic seems more related to a line of thought, practical
refers to actions. For one thing, you seem to always hear someone say "Be
practical" but you don't seem to hear "Be pragmatic."
