Happy New Year from the United States to our Chinese brothers and sisters!
Many Americans love China very much and hope that our countries will grow
closer together. We respect China's rise and it's wonderful and powerful
culture!  We wish every success to your people, happiness for Chinese
children, and comfort for Chinese seniors!  We remember our combined sacrifice
during the second world war as allies! You are the bright sun of the east!
Eternal peace and happiness between both our countries!ï»¿
