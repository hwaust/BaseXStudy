[Q] I understand "on" should be used in the following two situations:
1) on Monday afternoon
2) on the afternoon of Monday, July 3.

But what about "on the afternoons of Monday and Friday" ? Should I use "on" or
"in" here? (Google seems to lean to "in".)

Thanks in advance!


[A] If in doubt, spell it out :D Intonation and pauses are good for speech but
don't work so well in written form. If this is an email or letter or something,
then it should be unambiguous, even if that makes it long!

Good question. It would really depend on your intonation.

If you mean, "on the afternoons of Monday, Wednesday and Friday," then you would
not put very much of a pause between the names of the days.
"Monday-Wednesday-and Friday afternoons" would be said quickly.

If you mean "all day Monday, all day Wednesday, and afternoon on Friday," then
you would place a longer pause after Monday and Wednesday. "Monday, [pause],
Wednesday [pause], and Friday afternoon."

Or if you're talking about every week (not just a particular week), then you
could say "Mondays, Wednesdays, and Friday afternoons." Making the first two
days plural makes it clear that you're talking about the entire day.
