* What is a conjunction? （连词）
A conjunction is a part of speech that connects. It can connect sentences,
clauses, groups of words, or two individual words. Sometimes a conjunction is
a single word: because, and, so, but, etc. Other conjunctions consist of two
or more words: neither . . . nor, either . . . or, so that, etc. We divide
conjunctions into three types: coordinating, subordinating and correlative.

* Coordinating conjunctions （并列连词）
The seven coordinating conjunctions are so, and, but, or, yet, for, nor. A
coordinating conjunction joins words, groups of words, or clauses, and gives
them equal importance:
- I like summer, but I don’t like winter.
- Do you prefer summer or winter?
- He’s been working all day, so he’s very tired.

* Subordinating conjunctions （从属连词）
A subordinating conjunction connects a main (independent) and subordinate
(dependent) clause. The clause beginning with a subordinating conjunction is
always the subordinate clause, which depends on the main clause and cannot
exist without it.
Common subordinating conjunctions include:
- because, so that, as, since
  to express cause or reason
- before, after, until, when, as soon as, whenever, while
  to express time
- unless, if, even if, in case, providing
  to express condition
- although, even though, whereas
  to express contrast or concession

* Correlative conjunctions
Correlative conjunctions are pairs. They connect balanced clauses, phrases or
words. The elements which they connect are usually similar in structure or
length. Here are some examples.
- either...or
  We can go to either Greece or Spain for our holiday.
- both...and
  Both rugby and football are popular in France.
- not only...but also
  Not only is he a professional footballer, but he’s also a successful
  businessman.
- neither...nor
  Neither Norway nor Switzerland is in the EU.
- not...but
  There are not two but three Baltic states: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
