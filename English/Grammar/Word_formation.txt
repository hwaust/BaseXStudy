Word formation
There are three ways of form a words: blending, calque and neologism.

Blending
A blend is a word formed by joining parts of two words after clipping.
An example is smog, which comes from smoke and fog, or brunch, which comes
from 'breakfast' and 'lunch'.
One subcategory of blending is the reduction of a word to one of its parts,
e.g., fax (facsimile), flu (influenza) and bot (robot).
Note: Such clipped words may not retain their original meaning. For example,
"playing a video game against a bot" is not the same as "playing a video game
against a robot".

Calque
A calque is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal,
word-for-word or root-for-root translation. For example, the English phrase to
lose face is a calque from the Chinese "丟臉/丢脸."
A subcategory of calques is the semantic loan, that is, the extension of the
meaning of a word to include new, foreign meanings.

Neologism
A neologism is a process of forming a new word by coining such as quark
Subcategories of neologisms include:
  + The eponym, a proper noun that becomes commonly used for an idea it is
associated with, usually by changing its part of speech, like Xerox,
Orwellian, and Stentorian
  + The loanword, a word borrowed from another language, as cliché is from
    French
  + An onomatopoeic word, a word which imitates natural sounds, like the bird
    name cuckoo
  + Formation using phono-semantic matching, that is, matching a foreign word
    with a phonetically and semantically similar, pre-existing native word or
    root.
