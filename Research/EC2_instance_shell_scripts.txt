I am running a free t2.micro 64-bit EC2 instance. Amazon's AMI linux 
comes with OpenJDK. The command java -version showed AMI had Java 7
out-of-the-box. To upgrade to 8 I did 
1) installed OpenJDK 8 
$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel 
2) switched to 8 
$ sudo alternatives --config java. 
The command "java -version" then reported open JDK version "1.8.0_45" etc.
