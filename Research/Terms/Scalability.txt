Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a
growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged in order to accommodate
that growth.
For example, it can refer to the capability of a system to increase its total
output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added.
An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an economic context,
where scalability of a company implies that the underlying business model
offers the potential for economic growth within the company.

Database scalability
A number of different approaches enable databases to grow to very large size
while supporting an ever-increasing rate of transactions per second.
One technique supported by most of the major database management system (DBMS)
products is the partitioning of large tables, based on ranges of values in a
key field. In this manner, the database can be scaled out across a cluster of
separate database servers. Also, with the advent of 64-bit microprocessors,
multi-core CPUs, and large SMP multiprocessors, DBMS vendors have been at the
forefront of supporting multi-threaded implementations that substantially scale
up transaction processing capacity.

# A good point
# It is often advised to focus system design on hardware scalability rather
than on capacity. It is typically cheaper to add a new node to a system in
order to achieve improved performance than to partake in performance tuning to
improve the capacity that each node can handle.

In the context of high performance computing there are two common notions:
* Strong scaling: How the solution time varies with the number of processors
for a fixed total problem size.
* Weak scaling: How the solution time varies with the number of processors for
a fixed problem size per processor.[10]
