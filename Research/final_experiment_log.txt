12:00 create two free EC2 instances t2.micro for test.

2018-06-06 
10:00 test scripts
12:00 test the network of EC2 instance in different regions, including
      Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore, and some Cities in US. 
19:00 The best network is in Seoul, so picked this region.
19:30 create 500 GB throughput optimized HHD for storing XML documents
      * mount disk 
      1) create a volume, namely /dev/sdf and format: 
      $ sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdf 
      3) mount disk: 
      $ mount /dev/sdf to ~/data
      
20:38 finish the splitting xmark160.xml into 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 
      128 chunks. 
21:38 generate xmark1000.xml
      1) upload xmlgen.c to an EC2 instance @ 13.209.41.145
      $ scp -i ec2key_seoul.pem xmark.c ec2-user@13.209.41.145:data
      2) install gcc 
      $ sudo yum install gcc 
      3) compile 
      $ gcc xmlgen.c -o xmlgen.out 
      4) generate xml documents 
      $ ./xmlgen.out -f 160 -o xmark160.xml 
23:03 finish the splitting xmark1000.xml into 128 chunks.
      $ java -cp bfs.jar utils.FileDivider xmark1000.xml 128
      
2018-06-07
08:30 rewrite the coding in BFS for timing. 

2018-06-08
09:00 keep modifying the timing code 
23:00 finished the timing 

2018-06-09
10:00 tested and confirm the correctness of BFS
14:50 start an EC2 instance m5.2xlarge from online control web pages
      * m5.2xlarge, 8 threads, 32 GB, EBS Only, $0.496/Hour
15:00 create data folder and grand all access rights.
      $ mkdir data
      $ chmod 777 data
15:10 distribute xmark160.xml to from aux to worker1 
      *problem: too slow, less than 10 MB/s. This is because the 
      current master is a free one (t2.micro) with limited network.
16:11 launch a m5.large instance 
      * m5.large, 2 threads, 8 GB, EBS Only, cost $0.124/Hour
16:20 Copy data to test network
      Problem: cannot connect to the new instance.
16:48 The problem was caused by "Security Group"
      * solution: change "default" to "launch-wizard-1" 
16:55 test the network speed between m5.large and m5.2xlarge 
      $ 
17:10 test the connection between master and worker via bfs.jar 
      Problem: cannot connect.
18:10 Solved the problem. 
      Solution: allow all IP and port in inbound group from 
                "Security Group" setting.
18:20 Failed for insufficient memory.  
      java.lang.NullPointerException

18:30 Add -Xmx8g and -Xms8g for four workers and execute again.
18:40 Finished
18:41 Start running 2 workers
18:51 Failed. I consider it was caused by insufficient memory.
      The first worker takes 16+ GB memory, the second 13+ GB, thus 
      causing the first one terminated. 
19:05 Set -Xmx20g -Xmx16g  and run again.
19:15 Failed again. Checked logs and found: "terminated by signal 9".
      After googled, I found that "Signal 9 means that the application
      needs to be killed, it is not handled by the process, but by the
      Linux scheduler." Thus, it is another way of OOM-killer. 
19:45 skipped the above problem and begin to test 1 worker case.  
      OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: INFO: os::commit_memory

      allocate memory' (errno=12)
19:56 Add 10 GB of General Purpose (SSD) at /dev/sdg 
      $ sudo mkswap /dev/sdg
      $ sudo swapon /dev/sdg
      $ swapon -s

      /dev/xvdg       partition  	10485756	0	 -2      
20:05 Start to run 1 worker case again.
20:19 When processing QX4, it was too slow due to insufficient memory.
20:20 Add System.gc() and run it again.
