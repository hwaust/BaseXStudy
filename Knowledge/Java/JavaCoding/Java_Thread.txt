Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated? [1]

* Why is Thread.stop deprecated?
Because it is inherently unsafe. Stopping a thread causes it to unlock all the
monitors that it has locked. (The monitors are unlocked as the ThreadDeath
exception propagates up the stack.) If any of the objects previously protected
by these monitors were in an inconsistent state, other threads may now view
these objects in an inconsistent state. Such objects are said to be damaged.
When threads operate on damaged objects, arbitrary behavior can result. This
behavior may be subtle and difficult to detect, or it may be pronounced.
Unlike other unchecked exceptions, ThreadDeath kills threads silently; thus,
the user has no warning that his program may be corrupted. The corruption can
manifest itself at any time after the actual damage occurs, even hours or days
in the future.
