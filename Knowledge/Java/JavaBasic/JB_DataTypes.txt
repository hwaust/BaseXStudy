Everything lives indside a class.
Java is a strongly typed language.

P65
Every variable must have a declared type.
There are eight primitive types in Java.
Java has an arbitrary-precision arithmetic package.

Integer
The integer types are for numbers without fractional parts.
int     4 bytes  -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647
short   2 bytes  -32,768 to 32,767
long    8 bytes  -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
byte    1 byte   -128 to 127

In most situations, the int type is the most practical.
Long integer has a suffix L.
Number can be written in binary with a prefix '0b' since Java 7, such as 0b0010.


Floating-point numbers & double(-precision) number
significant decimal digits:
Numbers of type float have a suffix F (for exapmle, 3.14F).
Floating numbers without an F are always considered to be of type double. You
can optionally supply with the D suffix (for example, 3.14D).

2^10 : The base of the exponent is 2, not 10.
