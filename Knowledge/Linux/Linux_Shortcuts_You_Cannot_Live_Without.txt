1. Tab
The most handy shortcut and time saver for the linux command line. This actually
makes navigating directories faster in the CLI than the traditional GUI browser.
Simply start typing the command, filename, or directory and hit tab. Bash will
automatically complete what you are typing. It even works at the lilo prompt and
in some X applications.

2. Ctrl + c
Stop that program dead in its tracks. This is the command line version of end
task.

3. Ctrl + z
Send the current process to background. This is useful if you have a program
running, and you need the terminal for awhile but don’t want to exit the program
completely. Type the command fg to get the process back.
Note: If you communicate with a backgrouned program, your current program will
be in the state of waiting untill the backgrouneded program is fronted again.

4. Ctrl + d
Log out from the current terminal. If you use this in an X terminal emulator
such as xterm it will usually close it after logging out.

5. Ctrl + u
Erase the current line. I use this one all the time when I type the wrong
command in.

6. Ctrl + Alt + F1, (F1-F6)
Switch to the first virtual terminal. In Linux, you can have several virtual
terminals at the same time. The default is 6. (Ctrl + Alt + F7 to get back to X)

7. Ctrl + l (lowercase L)
Clear the terminal.

8. Ctrl + Alt + Backspace
Kill the X server. Use this if X crashes and you can’t exit it normally. If
you’ve configured GDM to start automatically at bootup, this restarts the server
and throws you back to the graphical login screen.

9. Ctrl + a
Move the cursor to the beginning of the current line. Useful for those times
you navigated all the way through 20 directories and forgot to add ‘cp’ to the
beginning. Use this instead of the arrow keys.

10. Ctrl + e
Last but not least get that cursor back to the end of the line.


* Controlling the Screen
The following shortcuts allow you to control what appears on the screen.
Ctrl+L: Clear the screen. This is similar to running the “clear” command.
Ctrl+S: Stop all output to the screen. This is particularly useful when running
        commands with a lot of long, verbose output, but you don’t want to stop
        the command itself with Ctrl+C.
Ctrl+Q: Resume output to the screen after stopping it with Ctrl+S.

Moving the Cursor
Use the following shortcuts to quickly move the cursor around the current line while typing a command.

Ctrl+A or Home: Go to the beginning of the line.
Ctrl+E or End: Go to the end of the line.
Alt+B:  Go left (back) one word.
Ctrl+B: Go left (back) one character.
Alt+F:  Go right (forward) one word.
Ctrl+F: Go right (forward) one character.
Ctrl+XX: Move between the beginning of the line and the current position of the
         cursor. This allows you to press Ctrl+XX to return to the start of the
         line, change something, and then press Ctrl+XX to go back to your
         original cursor position. To use this shortcut, hold the Ctrl key and
         tap the X key twice.

Ctrl+R: This lets you search your command history for something specific. For
        example, if you wanted to search for the recent commands that included
        nano, you would hit Ctrl+R and type nano. It would show your most recent
        command, and you could use the up and down arrows to cycle through your
        history of commands using nano in them.

Deleting Text
Use the following shortcuts to quickly delete characters:

Ctrl+D or Delete: Delete the character under the cursor.
Alt+D: Delete all characters after the cursor on the current line.
Ctrl+H or Backspace: Delete the character before the cursor.
