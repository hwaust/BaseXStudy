4. Adding a picture
Example:

\usepackage{GRAPHICX}
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{boat.jpg}
  \caption{A boat.}
  \label{fig:boat1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:boat1} shows a boat.


In order to include a figure, you must use the \includegraphics command. It
takes the image width as an option in brackets and the path to your image file.
Command \linewidth is put into the brackets, which means the picture will be
scaled to fit the width of the document. As a result smaller pictures are
upscaled and larger pictures downscaled respectively.  In this case the image is
stored in the same directory as my .tex file, so I simply put boat.jpg here to
include it.
Note: you will need to include the graphicx package in order to use this code.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{}
scale=1.0

\begin{figure}[h!]
h (here) - same location
t (top) - top of page
b (bottom) - bottom of page
p (page) - on an extra page
! (override) - will force the specified location
