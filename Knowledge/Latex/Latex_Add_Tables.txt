Example:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \caption{Caption for the table.}
  \label{tab:table1}
  \begin{tabular}{l|c||r}
    1 & 2 & 3\\
    \hline
    a & b & c\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{document}

The vertical lines are passed as an argument to the tabular environment (e.g.
\begin{tabular}{l|c||r} ) and the letters tell whether we want to align the
content to the left (l), to the center (c) or to the right (r) for each column.
Row seperators can be added with the \hline command. The \caption and \label
commands can be used in the same way as for pictures.


Using .csv files.
When writing papers, it is sometimes necessary to present a large amount of data
in tables. Writing such tables in LaTeX by hand is a very time-consuming and
error-prone task.
To avoid this, we can simply import the data directly from .csv (comma-separated
value) files. Programs such as Excel, OpenOffice Calc or even emacs org-mode can
export data sheets as .csv files. LaTeX can not work with them directly, but we
can use the following code, to generate tables from .csv files:
