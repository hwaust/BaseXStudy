Bibliography
Example:

\usepackage[backend=bibtex,style=verbose-trad2]{biblatex}
Random citation \cite{DUMMY:1} embeddeed in text.
\newpage
\bibliography{lesson7a1}
\bibliographystyle{ieeetr}

Use \bibliography to reference a bibli file and \bibliographystyle{} to
determine the stule of reference.

For BibLaTeX we have to choose the citation style on package inclusion with
\usepackage[backend=bibtex,style=verbose-trad2]{biblatex} the backend=bibtex
part makes sure to use BibTeX instead of Biber as our backend, since Biber fails
to work in some editors like TeXworks. It took me a while to figure out how to
generate footnotes automatically, because the sources I found on the internet,
didn't mention this at all.
