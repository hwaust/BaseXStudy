Special Characters
Characters in [# $ % ^ & _ { } ~ \] can be used in a document all the same by
using a prefix backslash.

ch   escape
#    \#
$    \$
%    \%
^    \^
&    \&
_    \_
{    \{
}    \}
~    \~
\    \backslash.
|    $~|~$  or \verb or \mid


According to texdoc symbols:
\mvert and \mid are identical and produce a relation. \vert is a synonym for |
and both produce the same symbol, but should be used in the context of an
ordinal, and should be used as an operator, not as a delimiter (p54, bottom).
\divides once again produces the same symbol but should be used as a binary
“divides” operator. \lvert and \rvert are left and right delimiters, respectively.

Example
$S = \{\, x \mid x \not= 17 \,\}$
$a \vert b$ implies $a \leq b$ when $b \ne 0$
$a|b$ implies $a \leq b$ when $b \ne 0$
$\lvert x \rvert$ is always non-negative

S = {x | x != 17}
a|b implies a <= b when b != 0
a|b implies a <= b when b != 0
|x| is always non-negative
