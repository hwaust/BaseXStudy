1ï¼ŽThe basic layout of a LATEX file.
Every document are enclosed in a document.

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
  Hello World!
\end{document}

The commands \begin and \end defines an environment that is simply an area of
your document where certain typesetting rules apply. It is possible (and usually
necessary) to have multiple environments in a document, but it is *imperative*
the document environment is the topmost environment.

Change *article* to *carticle* for supporting Chinese.

The area before our main document is called preamble.


2. Setions and paragraphs

\section{}
\subsection{}
\subsubsection{}

\paragraph{}
\subparagraph{}


Section
there are three levels:
/section{title}: Top level.
/subsection{title}: Second level.
/subsubsection{title}: Paragraph level.


3. Packages

LaTeX offers a lot of functions by default, but in some situations it can become
in handy to use so called packages. To import a package in LaTeX, you simply add
the \usepackage directive to the preamble of your document:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{PACKAGENAME}
\begin{document}
...

* Packages add new functions to LaTeX
* All packages must be included in the preamble
* Packages add features such as support for pictures, links and bibliography




5. Create tables of contents.
Use command \tableofcontents at the beginning of a document environment.
So easy!
\listoftables list of tables.
\listoffigures list of figures.
