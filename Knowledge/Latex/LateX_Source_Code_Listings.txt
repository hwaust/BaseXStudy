VBScript, Verilog, VHDL4, VRML4, XML, XSLT. For some of them, several dialects
are supported. For more information, refer to the documentation that comes with
the package, it should be within your distribution under the name
listings-*.dvi.

Notes
It supports Mathematica code only if you are typing in plain text format. You can't include *.NB files \lstinputlisting{...} as you could with any other programming language, but Mathematica can export in a pretty-formatted LaTeX source.
Specification of the dialect is mandatory for these languages (e.g. language={[x86masm]Assembler}).
Modelica is supported via the dtsyntax package available here.
For these languages, multiple dialects are supported. C, for example, has ANSI, Handel, Objective and Sharp. See p. 12 of the listings manual for an overview.
