- Auto-flow = ctrl-alt-q, alt-q
- Auto-complete
- Auto-correction = ctrl-shift-:
- Shortcuts
  · Tabs: close = ctrl-w
  · Tabs: next = ctrl-tab
  · Tabs: previous = ctrl-shift-tab

* Reset keybindings
1) CMD+,to open the setting page ("File->Setting" from main memu.)
2) Click on "your keymap file" below the title "Keybindings".
3) Add the following content into the opened file.
'atom-text-editor':
    'alt-q': 'hard-wrap:reflow-selection'
Note that if 'hard-wrap' does not work, change it to 'autoflow', i.e.
'atom-text-editor':
    'alt-q': 'autoflow:reflow-selection'

this is a problme.
